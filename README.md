# Insurance_charge
Here, using data on Kaggle.com, I plotted charge vs. BMI regression line on insurance customer data.
Unfortunately, the correlation between BMI and Charge was not strong to use it as a predictive function.
There are also other plots in this code, like histograms of patients' age.
